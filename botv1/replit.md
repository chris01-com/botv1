## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Python Discord Bot**: Built using discord.py library with slash commands
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Relational database for persistent data storage
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Fully async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- **Flask Web Server**: Simple HTTP server for health checks and keepalive pings

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for all quest data, user progress, and configuration
- **Connection Pooling**: asyncpg connection pool for efficient database operations
- **Migration System**: Built-in migration tools to convert from JSON to PostgreSQL

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Discord OAuth**: Built-in Discord authentication through bot permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Custom permission system based on Discord roles and server permissions
- **Permission Levels**: Quest creation restricted to moderators, admins, and specific roles

## Key Components

### Core Models
- **Quest**: Main quest entity with title, description, requirements, rewards, rank, and category
- **QuestProgress**: Tracks user progress through quests (accepted, completed, approved, rejected)
- **UserStats**: Aggregated statistics for user quest activity
- **Channel Configuration**: Server-specific channel mappings for quest workflow

### Quest Management
- **QuestManager**: Central orchestrator for quest lifecycle operations
- **Database Layer**: Async PostgreSQL operations with connection pooling
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control for quest creation and management

### User Interface
- **Slash Commands**: Modern Discord slash command interface
- **Rich Embeds**: Formatted Discord embeds for quest display
- **Channel Workflow**: Dedicated channels for quest listing, acceptance, submission, and approval

## Data Flow

### Quest Creation Flow
1. User with permissions creates quest via slash command
2. Quest data validated and stored in PostgreSQL
3. Quest displayed in designated quest list channel
4. Quest becomes available for acceptance by eligible users

### Quest Acceptance Flow
1. User attempts to accept quest in designated channel
2. System validates user permissions and role requirements
3. Rate limiting enforced (24-hour cooldown between attempts)
4. Quest progress record created with "accepted" status
5. User statistics updated

### Quest Completion Flow
1. User submits quest completion with proof (text/images)
2. Submission stored in quest progress with "completed" status
3. Notification sent to approval channel for moderator review
4. Moderator approves/rejects submission
5. User statistics and quest status updated accordingly

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **discord.py**: Discord API interaction and bot functionality
